Instructions:
1. Inputting your deck
	Click on "Set Deck". This will bring up a window with a text field. Input the name of each card in your deck, exactly as they are written on the card, then press "Enter" or "Return" on your keyboard after each card. When you are finished inputting the names of all cards in your deck, 'x' out of the window. This generates an HTML file to the working directory of the app, so don't be alarmed if you see an HTML file appear while using the YGOMT app.

2. Viewing your rulings
	Click on "Check Your Deck's Rulings". This will bring up a window with a list of your cards and hyperlinks to quickly view the rulings for each. These rulings are very helpful in determining card interactions.

3. Checking Turn Bias
	Click on "Check Your Deck's Turn Bias". This will bring up a window with several fields. The first field is the total number of cards in your deck. Put this in first, and do not change this number. The second field (from left to right), is the number of copies of a particular card. This field should be a 1, 2, or 3. The final field is the turn bias of a particular card. This will be a 1, 2, or 3:
1 - You want to draw this card when going first. Examples are swarm cards or trap cards.
2 - It does not matter if you go first or second when drawing this card. Examples include cards like Mystical Space Typhoon.
3 - You want to draw this card when going second. Examples are interrupters like Raigeki or Heavy Storm (Aware that HS is banned).

Fill all three fields on top for each card, then press "Add Card" to add it to the sum. Change the fields for the second card, third, etc. When finished, press "Calculate Bias". The field at the bottom right will display your deck's turn bias.

How to use this information: 
1.0 - 1.65 : Your deck should always go first, given the opportunity. 
1.66 - 1.72 : Your deck can swing either way, depending on the opponent. 
1.73 - 3.0 : Your deck should generally go second, given the opportunity.


4. LP Calculator
	Click on "LP Calculator". This will bring up a window with four fields, four buttons, and a large text display area. To change LP, enter a number to add or subtract in either of the second field down for either player, then press "+" or "-" to add or subtract. Changes are outputted to the large text area as a log of LP changes.

5. Coin Flip
	Click on "Flip a Coin". This will bring up a window with a button. Press the button to get a coin flip result; either heads or tails.

6. Dice Roll
	Click on "Roll a Die". This will bring up a window with a button. Press the button to get a die roll result; 1 through 6.
